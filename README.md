## Podcasts

## 2021

- [Elixir Mix
 #148 Event Sourcing and CQRS ft. Ben Moss](https://elixirmix.com/event-sourcing-and-cqrs-ft-ben-moss-emx-148) - Discusion about Event Sourcing and CQRS in Elixir. Event sourcing is the practice of logging data across logged series of events and then reconstructing data from the events. CQRS is focused on keeping read and write operations from conflicting.

- [Thinking Elixir #075 RabbitMQ and Commanded at Simplebet with Dave Lucia](https://thinkingelixir.com/podcast-episodes/075-rabbitmq-and-commanded-at-simplebet-with-dave-lucia/) - Talk about Simplebet's use of RabbitMQ and Commanded for solving unique real-time problems. We learn how Simplebet uses Elixir when creating real-time sports betting markets. We also learn what CQRS systems are, how the Commanded library supports that in Elixir, and how Commanded pairs well with RabbitMQ.
